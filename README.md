# the_senate
A Discord Bot to play The Senate (WIP)

If you intend to use this bot yourself, you will need to provide your own Discord Bot token. Create a file called "token.txt", place it next to "main.py", and put your token inside it. You will also need to create a folder called "saves" for the bot to store savedata.
